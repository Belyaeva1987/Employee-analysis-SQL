# Employee-analysis-SQL

The goal of the analysis is the research project about people whom ABC company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, the tables were designed to hold the data from the CSV files, then CSV files were imported into a SQL database, and then several questions were answered about the data. To complete this project data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis were performed.
